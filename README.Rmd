The goal of simpleschoolsR is to alleviate the burden of importing, cleaning, and
matching data sets that rely on U.S. school names and addresses as the primary key. 
For example, an analyst who wishes to join data from the National Center for Education
Statistics to data from the Civil Rights DAta Collection may be able to
use NCES IDs. However, in instances where a common ID is not available,
names and addresses may allow for matching...when they are accurate and
consistent across data frames. Unfortunately, this is rarely the case, resulting
in a frustrating and costly experience for the analyst. This package seeks to
alleviate basic issues stemming from these inconsistencies.
