Description: The simpleschoolsR package is collection of concise data sets and 
 functions designed to alleviate the burden of importing, cleaning, and
 matching data sets with U.S. schools as a primary key. For example,
 an analyst who wishes to join data from the National Center for Education
 Statistics to data from the Civil Rights DAta Collection may be able to
 use NCES IDs. However, in instances where a common ID is not available,
 names and addresses may allow for matching...when they are accurate and
 consistent across data frames. Unfortunately, this is rarely the case, resulting
 in a frustrating and costly experience for the analyst. This package seeks to
 alleviate basic issues stemming from these inconsistencies.
